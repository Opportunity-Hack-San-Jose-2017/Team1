# City of San Jose - Walk n' Roll

[Walk n’ Roll San José](http://www.getstreetsmarts.org/walknroll/) is funded by the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission through its Climate Initiatives Program with the goal of increasing walking and biking to school, fostering 
a healthy and active lifestyle, and reducing traffic congestion and related air pollution, leading to a safer environment
within school zones. Currently, data is being collecting manually from the various participating schools
( [Data CollectionForm](http://www.getstreetsmarts.org/downloads/walknroll/StudentTally.pdf)). The current process is 
both cumbersome as well as burdening on the participating schools.

As part of the [Opportunity Hack](https://opportunity-hack-san-jose-2017.devpost.com/), the team is looking at improving
the data collection and processing. This repository provides the code that has been developed in the hackathon.

## Goal

Build an application that helps with automating the data collection process as well as provides insightful analytics &
reports based on this data.
